	<p style= "text-align:center color:blue">Hello, My name is Crawford Pierson and I'm going to tell you a little about myself. I'm a Psychology and Criminal Justice student. I really like serial killers, so I'm going to tell you about my favorite. </p>
	<p style=color:green> John Wayne Gacy is my favorite serial killer. His daytime job consisted of being a clown, but his hobby was preying on little boys. John Wayne took the life of at least 33 young men. He buried 26 of them under his crawl space in his house. </p>
	<p style=color:white> He is famous for creepy paintings he did while in jail. I have attached the a hyperlink showing them. </p>
